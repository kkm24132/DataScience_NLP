## Fundamentals and Basics
- Stopwords: Stop words are words which occur frequently in a text corpus. e.g a, an, the, in. Frequently occurring words are removed from the corpus for the objective of text-normalization. We can import ```from nltk.corpus import stopwords``` to leverage this facility
- Stemming: It is reduction of inflection from words. Words with same origin will get reduced to a form which may or may not be a word. NLTK has different stemmers which implement different methodologies.
